# SEO Keyword Cluster Manager

## Core Experience

A lightweight tool for SEO professionals to organize keyword research into hierarchical topical maps. Users create projects, then build nested keyword clusters that represent content strategies—pillar pages at the top level with supporting subtopics and long-tail keywords nested beneath them.

Each keyword captures the essential data needed for content planning: search volume, intent, publication status, and the type of content to create. Users can also document the strategic rationale behind targeting each keyword and track which competitors currently rank for it.

The interface centers on an expandable tree table that mirrors the mental model of topic clusters. Keywords can be dragged to reorder priorities or moved between clusters as strategy evolves. Filters help users focus on specific segments—like all draft content or commercial-intent keywords—while stats at the top provide a snapshot of the overall topical map.

The goal is simple: replace scattered spreadsheets with a purpose-built tool that makes keyword clustering visual, organized, and easy to maintain as content gets published and strategies shift.
